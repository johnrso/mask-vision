# mask-vision
Using TF and OpenCV to train a CNN classifier to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. Dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/vtech6/medical-masks-dataset.

## background
masks reduce the potency of airborne transmission of COVID-19, and is recommneded by various health organizations. however, a large subset of the population (is dumb) and refuses to wear masks; in response, private businesses and public spaces are now beginning to require that a mask is worn to access their services. this model is intended to work in real time to identify if a person is wearing a mask, and if so, if they are wearing it properly.
